## 🎯 VIDEO STRUCTURE

### Opening Hook (0:00 - 0:10)
**[Screen: Split screen - left shows messy terminal/FTP, right shows clean chat interface]**

**Voice:**
> "Deploying to cPanel usually means juggling FTP clients, SSH terminals, and permission errors. What if you could just... chat with AI instead?"

### The Problem (0:10 - 0:40)
**[Screen: Traditional cPanel deployment - screen recording]**

> - Jump to Cloudflare to add DNS records
> - Create MySQL databases
> - Fire up FileZilla or an FTP client
> - SSH in to fix file permissions
> - Hunt through error logs when things break"

```
🚀 I built Demetrly - an AI-powered deployment tool for cPanel

Instead of juggling FTP, SSH, and cPanel tabs, you just chat with AI:

"Deploy https://github.com/user/my-app"

The AI detects the project type, handles compatibility issues,
and deploys it - all through natural language.

Every subdomain gets its own AI assistant powered by Claude.
